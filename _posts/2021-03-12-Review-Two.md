# Review Two: _The Shakespeare and Company Project_

### Project: _The Shakespeare and Company Project_

### Project Director(s): Joshua Kotin

### Project URL: https://shakespeareandco.princeton.edu 

_The Shakespeare and Company Project_ is an in-depth study of Sylvia Beach’s lending library and bookstore in Paris. The shop is still open to this day but this project studies when it was first created by Sylvia Beach from 1919-1941. There were hundreds of members of the lending library in its early days including some famous authors such as Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, and James Joyce. The creators of this project's intentions were to recreate this home away from home for many of the Lost Generation during the first world war in Paris. 

This site was originally created in 2014 by Joshua Kotin (director), Jesse D. McCarthy (Project Manager), and Clifford E. Wulfman (Technical Lead). The project, originally titled “_Mapping Expatriate Paris_” uses three main sources for most of the information found, these being: Sylvia Beach's _Shakespeare and Company_ (1959); Noel Riley Fitch's _Sylvia Beach and the Lost Generation: A History of Literary Paris in the Twenties and Thirties_ (1983); and Keri Walsh's _The Letters of Sylvia Beach_ (2010). The web applications used to create the project were _Python_ and _Django_. The use of these programs makes the site very user friendly and interactive. 

Financial support was primarily from several Princeton institutions such as: The Center for Digital Humanities, Innovation Fund for New Ideas in the Humanities,  David A. Gardner '69 Magic Grant, and University Committee on Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences.

The site starts off taking you to a nice cover page that directs you to scroll down where you find a small introduction to the project. I would recommend making the arrow indicating to scroll down a little more noticeable as it is white on grey and may be difficult to see by some viewers.

To look further into the site you need to click on the white box with three grey lines in the top right corner that will take you to a menu of the five main sections of the site. These main sections are: members, books, analysis, sources, and about. Each of these sections are then divided into further categories found under the main headings. The box to the menu is pretty noticeable once you have glanced around the site for a second but it could be difficult or passed over by some viewers. As this box is very important because it takes you to the majority of the project it may be helpful to make it stand out a bit more or have a caption pointing it out. 

The guide menu lets you choose different options to learn more about the history of the lending library with things such as all the old members and books that were in circulation. In both the list there are customizable options to control how the list is sorted or to search for individual things. This was a really nice feature that allowed for a more custom experience. When you hover the mouse over each individual item listed a green text will pop up taking you to more information on the selected item. The green text is a really useful addition as it pops out against the white background. Next to some names or books is also a blue box that means there is no adequate information on the subject. It may be useful to have a description or pop up explaining the blue boxes as you have to go to the frequently asked questions page under the about section to find what it means

One of the most simplistic yet helpful things on the website is that each link or clickable options are underlined in green. There are many different links to click taking you to different parts of the site that provide more information on the subject. The addition of this is very helpful as it gives the audience the availability to find all the information they want at ease in the order they want. The choice of underlining all links in green is also very helpful as it is very easily noticeable.

The creators of _The Shakespeare and Company Project_ have done a beautiful job of reviving this small oasis in a very dreadful time period. The project is beautifully designed in a very user friendly way. I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to learn about this small part of history.
