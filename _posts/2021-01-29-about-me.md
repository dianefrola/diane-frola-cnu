# About Me Diane Frola

My name is Diane Frola and I am a sophomore at Christopher Newport University, majoring in communication with a minor in film and writing. The writing minor is particularly why I am taking English 350. After college, my goal is to one day go into journalism and broadcasting or maybe film. I’ve always dreamed about working on movie sets doing camera and tech work. I’m a big movie buff so working in that field has always been an ideal I hope to achieve one day. I'm currently going through a big list of the best classic movie sof all time and watching all them in my free time. This means I've seen a lot of movies recently as all my time has been free in the past few months with the pandemic happening. A few of my favorites from the list have been: _Pulp Fiction_, _The Shawshank Redemption_, and _The Silence of Lambs_. My all-time favorite movie though is _Good Will Hunting_, as I have a special love for Robin Williams movies. Matt Damon with a Boston accent is also a great plus. Besides watching movies I spend a lot of time reading, doing photography, and playing soccer. I actually played the sport for ten years and then coached for three. My life has been all soccer all the time as both sister and brother have also been playing the sport since we were young. As well as being the oldest of three kids I am also the proud owner of the cutest dog in the world, at least in my opinion. His name is Mugsy and he’s the laziest dog ever, as well as super fat. I've been trying to get him on a diet for years but my dad and brother have a horrible habit of giving his too many table scraps. The photo shown below is of him and I on Halloween. I went as Rey from _Star Wars_ and he went as Chewbacca. When I'm not at home with my family or dressing up my dog as a fictional wookkiee warrior, I am a full-time student at Cnu. At school, I work as a writer and photographer for the school newspaper, [Captain's Log](http://thecaptainslog.org). I also work for their combined organization,[CNUTV](https://www.facebook.com/thecaptainslog/), as a videographer. Those are both just clubs though so in terms of real and official paying jobs, I work for CNU Athletics Production. So if you're ever at a CNU sporting event I will most likely be there filming. Hopefully, I will be able to film again soon if covid starts to get better, but until then I guess I'll go watch a movie.
