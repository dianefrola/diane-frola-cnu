#### **Summary**
The Scottish Witches Database is an electronic resource of the history of witches in Scotland between 1563 and 1736. Created by Julian Goodare, Dr. Louise Yeoman, et al, for the University of Edinburgh, the project has multiple interactive maps to help viewers learn about the 3,212 known cases of accused witchcraft in early modern Scotland. The goal of the project was to geolocate the data of all the known witches and their histories including class, jobs, trials, accusations, and other social and historical themes. 

#### **Relevance**
This project does a good job of showing the history of Scotland Witches by primarily using interactive maps. The maps give you insight into who these people were and what happened to them. This is a difficult topic to cover as there is not much information written about the lives of these people. The directors all had a great deal of knowledge on the topic coming into the project with Julian Goodard a lecturer in Scottish History at the University of Edinburgh. As well as Dr. Louise Yeoman who was formerly a curator at the National Library of Scotland, later a researcher with BBC Scotland.


#### **Findings**
The project does a great job of showing all the collected data on the topic of Scotland Witches from 1563-1736. Even so, the project can be difficult for new people on the subject. Someone with previous knowledge on the subject will most likely find this project very useful. As a person who has had no prior knowledge of the Scotland witches before this project it was very confusing at first. It would be useful to add more basic information on the history and relevance of these witches to help new learners on the topic. 

The design and layout of the project are difficult to grasp at first and may take a bit of time to start to understand. It took me a few hours of just randomly clicking on things to start figuring out what I was looking at and how each of the maps functioned. 

There is very imortant information on the site that is very hard to notice. Headings, map legends, and information icons are to see and understand. All of these are in very light grey coloring with white backgrounds and are easy to miss. I would suggest having the headings a lot bolder and in a darker color. I would also suggest already having the map legends and information all ready popped up and not under a different tab as the information provided in both sections are crucial in understanding the project.

Once you understand the design of the project and find all the necessary information it becomes a lot of fun to click around and learn about each witch. The witches are shown placed around the map by little icons of a person. Each witch icon is a different color based on the map you are looking at and the legend preferences that you can customize. Each witch has a small pop up biography that will show when you click on their icon. In the small pop up is also an option to click a link leading to more information of the individual on a different website. I enjoyed being able to learn more about each witch but I would suggest not having the link take you to a different site as it just leads to more confusion on how to work a different site which also had a confusing design.

Theew is an about section but it does not provide much information. To get the real information about the project you need to click on the website link in the “background of the project” section in the about section. This link will take you to another website that gives you a bunch of links to different information on the project. I would suggest having more information in the project about page as many may not realize they have to click on a diffrent link to get to more informaton. There is also a header labeled “blog” that will take you to a blog about the creation of the project.

This project overall is very useful to learn more about the witches of Scotland from 1563-1736. It provides a lot of useful information and data on the subject and individual witches. To someone that studies the topic, it can be a very helpful and informational tool.
