For my grant, I am proposing the creation of an interactive map and timeline following the lives of two of the most influential female pirates. Anne Bonny and Mary Read are some of the few women pirates in history. Piracy was a man’s game and these women broke many barriers to sail the seas as well as any of their male colleagues. 

These women sailed around the world during their lives and I want to create a map following their journey. Having interactive visuals like a map and timeline will help the audience better understand the lives of these two women and what they accomplished. 

Many don’t know but piracy was a very important part of the creation of America. The Golden Age of Piracy, when Bonny and Read lived, was from 1650-1730. This was a very influential time in history as the Americas were becoming an important part of the global economy and many countries were trying to lay claim to some of the land. Located primarily in the Bahamas piracy had a huge influence on the economy as they stole ships with valuable resources at a fast rate. They were so impactful they also completely demolished the slave trade that was a majority of the world’s economy at the time. The fact that two women became part of this legacy was a harrowing feat that only a few accomplished. 

Anne was born in Ireland before moving to America with her husband in search of work. Whereas Mary was born in England and served in the military before moving to America. In New Providence Anne met Jack Rackman (aka Calico Jack) and fell in love. Jack did something no other pirate captain had done and let a woman join his crew. Mary joined the crew later on when Jack’s men stole a boat that Mary was on. Anne and Mary became fast friends and sailed the seven seas as part of Rackmans crew until they were caught by the British military. All of Jack’s crew including Anne and Mary were imprisoned and sentenced to death. Mary and Anne ended up being the only members to not be hung as by some lady luck they both were pregnant at the time of their trials. As was the law any person pregnant was not allowed to face a death penalty. After the trials Mary sadly died in prison and no one knows what happened to Anne Bonny. Now of course this is one of the shortest possible summaries of their lives and they did and accomplished so much that could be talked about. But this shows just how much they traveled  around the world and how much they did in such a short amount of time. Their lives were filled with adventures and I think creating a map to track their journeys will give an audience a great insight into who these women were. 

Piracy has always been a niche topic that I have loved. I have spent a lot of years researching pirates and particularly these two women so I came into this project with a lot of previous knowledge. Even so I think this project has really given me a different perspective into these women's lives that I never thought about before. It was really interesting to take a step back and consider these women's lives in more of a geographical way. They saw and did so much in their lives and it's fascinating to see their journeys on a different scale. 

For my project I was initially going to follow the lives of four women pirates being Anne Bonny, Mary Read, Grace O'Malley and Mrs Cheng. O’Mally and Cheng are also powerful female pirates that had a great influence on history. Mrs Cheng is actually credited to be the best pirate of all time as she commanded a fleet of 50,000 pirates and 2,000 ships. I ended up only focusing on Read and Bonny because including the lives of four people would be out of budget. O'Malley and Cheng also lived in different places and times. Cheng commanded her fleet out of China in the early 1800s and Grace sailed from Ireland in the late 1500s. So focusing on Anne and Mary creates an easier and more seamless project as they both lived and sailed at the same time and place. Their stories are woven together and you can not tell one woman's life without the other. Besides going from four women to two my initial plans for the grant pretty much stayed the same. 

I have really loved doing this project. Getting to do it on a topic that I love made me really enjoy the experience. I probably never will make the project I’m proposing but I really like the idea of people learning more about these amazing women. Who knows maybe one day someone will create something based on Mary and Anne. Until that day comes I really enjoyed doing this grant and getting to share some knowledge about two of my life heroes.
